## 🎯 What Makes It "Unfair"

From the **very first second**, Unfair Flappy Bird assaults you with:

- **Balanced but chaotic visual effects** (30% chance per pipe)
- **40% chance of pipe chaos** (starting from pipe 3)
- **20% chance of bird chaos** (input lag, wind, etc.)
- **5% chance of input lag** (down from 35%)
- **Random gravity shifts, wind gusts, and sudden death drops**
- **Invisible pipes, magnetic pulls, shrinking gaps, and fake pipes**

**Score 5 is a genuine achievement. Score 10 is legendary.**

## 🏗️ Pipe Chaos (12 Types × 4-7 Per Pipe!)

Every pipe has a **40-60% chance** to spawn chaos events:

### Movement Chaos

- **Gap Teleport** - Gap jumps ±120px instantly
- **Gap Drift** - Continuously moves while approaching
- **Double Troll** - Gap moves, then moves again 150ms later
- **Pipe Swap** - Swaps position with next pipe

### Visual Deception

- **Invisible Pipe** - Completely invisible until 60px away
- **Bait Pipe** - Looks real but has no collision (distractor)
- **Phantom Pipe** - Invisible collision near real pipe
- **Late Spawn** - Appears 50-150ms late

### Physics Traps

- **Magnet Pipe** - Pulls bird toward gap (up to 3px/frame)
- **Shrinking Pipe** - Narrows by 2% per frame
- **Fake Ceiling** - Invisible collision inside the gap
- **Collision Shift** - Hitbox offset from visual

### Base Traps (Random Assignment)

- **Troll Move** - Shifts suddenly when near
- **Fake Gap** - Gap is solid, kills on contact
- **Snap Close** - Shrinks to 5px in 80ms
- **Reverse Zone** - Controls inverted inside gap
- **Normal** - Rare! (10% chance)

## 🐦 Bird Chaos (7 Types, 95% Activation!)

Every pipe pass has **20% chance** to activate:

| Chaos             | Effect                   | Frequency        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------- |
| **Input Lag**     | 35% of flaps ignored     | Every press      |
| **Flap Random**   | Power varies 0.7x-1.3x   | Every flap       |
| **Flap Delay**    | 50-120ms delay           | Random           |
| **Sudden Drop**   | Downward velocity spike  | 15% per frame    |
| **Air Burst**     | 1.5x gravity for 5s      | 10% start chance |
| **Gravity Shift** | 0.3x-2.3x gravity        | 8% per frame     |
| **Wind Gust**     | ±150px/s horizontal push | 10% start chance |

## 🎮 How to Play

### Controls

- **Click / Tap / Space** - Flap (if it registers...)

### Pro Tips

1. **Use audio cues** - When you can't see, listen for sounds
2. **Expect failures** - 35% of inputs won't work
3. **Feel the magnet** - You'll sense the pull toward gaps
4. **Ignore bait pipes** - Some pipes are just distractions
5. **Memorize patterns** - Traps are chaotic but learnable
6. **Trust muscle memory** - Visuals will betray you constantly

### Scoring

- **Score 1-2**: Good start! Most don't get past 1.
- **Score 3-4**: Impressive! You're getting the hang of it.
- **Score 5+**: Legendary! You have mastered the chaos.
- **Score 10+**: GODLIKE! Screenshot this immediately.
